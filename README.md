An OBD compliant Bluetooth powered Android Application

This project uses an OBD library provided by Pires to retreive all OBD-related data and services on any Anroid Device. It works with all cars and requires two android devices to work. One of them will be used for remote access and must be registered with AutoCop TrackPro (or similar service), the other must be kept inside the car at all times.

It incudes features to setup a geofence. If the car is detected to be outside this ciruclar area, the application automatically launches and starts tracking the car on google maps. Using a phone number registered with AutoCop TrackPro it automises this whole tracking process via SMS facility and also gives the user an option to immobilize the car.
